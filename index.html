                    <p class="skill-description">I have a very good understanding on HTMl. I almost know all the tags and their proper use. I am also familiar with the versions of HTML. The power of XHTML, the semantic simplicity of HTML5, i know all of these. After all, as a quick learner i can make the markup for you and make your life easy.</p>

Though I am very used to all the tools in CSS but it's not easy to make peoples' imaginary design come true. As I practice patients then who'll be better?</p>
